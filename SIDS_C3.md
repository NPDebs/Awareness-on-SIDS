# METHODOLOGY

In this chapter, the methods used in the study are outlined, covering the research design, target population, sample and sample techniques, data collection tools, method of data collection, data analysis techniques, and ethical consideration.

## 3.1 Design
The research design for this study is a cross-sectional descriptive survey. The design was employed to determine the level of awareness of mothers on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) among women at Oroworukwo community in Port Harcourt. Since descriptive design is a type of study that explains the nature of a phenomenon at a specific point in time, it collects data once from the respondents and is appropriate to enable the researcher to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the level of their awareness.

## 3.2 Area of Study
The study was carried out in Oroworukwo Townhall situated in Oroworukwo community, Port-Harcourt. Oroworukwo is one of the rural areas located in Port-Harcourt Local Government Area, Rivers State, Nigeria. It sits about 24 km from the St John's bus stop and near the Aba road. It is a town hall where matters concerning the daily workings of the community are discussed. It serves as a first well-known meeting point for medical outreaches.

## 3.3 Target population
The target population for this study is all mothers who have children under 3 years in Oroworukwo community, Port-Harcourt. Population of mothers with children under 3 years was 180 (Source: CDC Chairman).

## 3.4 Sample size
Since the sample was community-based, there was no need for sampling.

## 3.5 Sampling Technique 
The total sample was used.
3.6 Instrument for Data Collection
The primary data collection tool used in this study was a self-developed questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended questions, which enabled the researcher collect data on the level of awareness of SIDS among the mothers in Oroworukwo community.

The instrument for data collection had 4 sections. Section 1 extracted the demographic data of the respondent. Sections 2-5 elicited the awareness of mothers on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and the final section collected data about any additional information the respondents needed to provide. The open-ended question allowed the respondent to write in provided spaces responses that were not provided in the instrument while the closed-ended questions allowed the respondent to choose a response from the options provided.

## 3.7 Validity of the Instrument
In order to ensure that the data collected is accurate and reliable, the questionnaire used in this study was subjected to tests of validity. Validity refers to the degree to which a measurement tool accurately measures what it is intended to measure.

To validate the data collection tool, it was submitted to and reviewed by the project supervisor and three research experts from the Department of Nursing at the University of Port-Harcourt. They examined the questionnaire's question sequence and arrangement, identified temporary ambiguities, and made necessary corrections. In addition, they ensured the questions aligned with the operationalised variables of interest. Their feedback was incorporated to better adapt the instrument to meet the study's objectives.

## 3.8 Reliability of the instrument
Reliability refers to the consistency of the measurements obtained from the tool. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using the test-retest method. Twenty (20) copies of the questionnaire were given to mothers to test the reliability of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered twice to the same group of participants, with a time interval of two weeks between administrations. The responses were analysed using the Pearson's Product Moment Coefficient (PPMC) to determine the consistency of the results. A reliability index of 0.80 was obtained, which showed that the instrument was reliable.

## 3.9 Method of Data Collection
Data collection was carried out using the self-administered questionnaire method. The researcher identified the households with children under three (3) years old and distributed the questionnaires to the participants in their homes, requesting that they fill it out at a convenient time during the day. The researcher provided a brief explanation of the purpose of the study and the instructions for completing the questionnaire. Data collection lasted for 12 days. A total of 180 copies of the instrument were administered to the respondents. Administered questionnaires were retrieved within two (2) days of administration.
3.10 Method of Data Analysis
Data collected was analysed using statistical methods. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data on the level of awareness of SIDS among the mothers. The data was presented using tables, graphs, and charts.

The instrument for data collection was designed to generate nominal (categorical), ordinal, and interval data. Based upon the fore mentioned, generated nominal and ordinal data was summarised using frequency and percentage. They were further analysed for relationships using Chi square. The generated interval data was summarised using mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage. It was further analysed for relationships using Chi square. Level of statistical significance was set at 5%. All data cleaning and analysis were done with the aid of Statistical Products and Service Solutions (IBM SPSS, Chicago) software version 25.

## 3.11 Ethical Consideration
The topic for the study was approved by the Nursing Department Research Committee in University of Port Harcourt. To gain administrative approval, a letter was sent to the Head of Department. The researcher informed prospective respondents about the study's aim, objectives, advantages, and challenges. All consenting respondents were kept anonymous since no personal identifying details were requested. Strict measures were in place to prevent any form of coercion on the participants, ensuring their involvement was entirely voluntary. Collected data was protected and exclusively used for the approved academic purpose.
