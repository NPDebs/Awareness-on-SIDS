# METHODOLOGY

In this chapter, the methods used in the study are outlined, covering the research design, target population, sample and sample techniques, data collection tools, method of data collection, data analysis techniques, and ethical consideration.

## 3.1 Design
The research design for this study is a cross-sectional descriptive survey. The design was employed to determine the level of awareness of mothers on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) among women at Oroworukwo community in Port Harcourt. Since descriptive design is a type of study that explains the nature of a phenomenon at a specific point in time, it collects data once from the respondents and is appropriate to enable the researcher to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the level of their awareness.

## 3.2 Area of Study
The study was carried out in Oroworukwo Townhall situated in Oroworukwo community, Port-Harcourt. Oroworukwo is one of the rural areas located in Port-Harcourt Local Government Area, Rivers State, Nigeria. It sits about 24 km from the St John's bus stop and near the Aba road. It is a town hall where matters concerning the daily workings of the community are discussed. It serves as a first well-known meeting point for medical outreaches.

## 3.3 Target population
The target population for this study is all mothers who have children under 3 years in Oroworukwo community, Port-Harcourt.

## 3.4 Sample size
A sample size of 200 mothers was selected using a convenience sampling technique. Convenience sampling was selected because it allows the researcher to collect data from participants who are easily accessible and available.
The sample size was determined using the formula for calculating sample size for a finite population. The sample size was calculated using the Taro Yamane (1967) formula:
n = N / (1 + N(e²))
Where n = sample size, N = size of target population, and e = tolerable error margin (assumed to be 5% or 0.05).
Thus, the sample size for this study is:
n = 328 / (1 + 328(0.05)²) = 180.22

The minimum calculated sample size was ~180. To adjust the minimum sample size for potential attrition or fallout, a non-response adjustment formula for prospective studies was applied. Thus, final sample size = n/(1-0.1) (Rota & Laitila, 2015). A final sample size of 200 was computed. The researcher increased the sample size to improve the accuracy of the study's findings.

## 3.5 Sampling Technique 
The target population for this study is all mothers who have children under 3years in Oroworukwo community, Port Harcourt. Since it is not feasible to study the entire population due to time and resource constraints, a sample was selected using a convenience sampling technique.
Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where the researcher selects participants who are readily available and easily accessible. This sampling technique was selected because it will enable the researcher to collect data from a large number of participants within a short time and at a lower cost.
The researcher used a list of households in Oroworukwo community to identify potential participants. The researcher visited the households and invited the mothers who meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the study.

The criteria for inclusion or enrolment of respondents into the study were that the mother must have a child under 3years and must be willing to participate in the study. The researcher ensured that the sample size of 200 participants is representative of the target population. 
## 3.6 Instrument for Data Collection
The primary data collection tool used in this study was a self-developed questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended questions, which enabled the researcher collect quantitative data on the level of awareness of SIDS among the mothers in Oroworukwo community.

The instrument for data collection had 4 sections. Section 1 extracted the demographic data of the respondent. Sections 2-5 elicited the awareness of mothers on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and the final section collected data about any additional information the respondents needed to provide. The open-ended question allowed the respondent to write in provided spaces responses that were not provided in the instrument while the closed-ended questions allowed the respondent to choose a response from the options provided.

## 3.7 Validity of the Instrument
In order to ensure that the data collected is accurate and reliable, the questionnaire used in this study was subjected to tests of validity and reliability. Validity refers to the degree to which a measurement tool accurately measures what it is intended to measure, while reliability refers to the consistency of the measurements obtained from the tool.

To validate the proposed data collection tool, it was submitted to and reviewed by the project supervisor and three research experts from the Department of Nursing at the University of Port-Harcourt. They examined the questionnaire's question sequence and arrangement, identified temporary ambiguities, and made necessary corrections. In addition, they ensured the questions aligned with the operationalised variables of interest. Their feedback was incorporated to better adapt the instrument to meet the study's objectives.

## 3.8 Reliability of the instrument
The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using the test-retest method. A pilot study was conducted on 20 mothers to test the reliability of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered twice to the same group of participants, with a time interval of two weeks between administrations. The responses were analysed using the test-retest reliability coefficient (Pearson's correlation coefficient) to determine the consistency of the results.

The results of the validity and reliability tests were reported in the results chapter to provide evidence of the accuracy and consistency of the data collected. These tests ensured that the data collected from the questionnaire is valid and reliable, thus increasing the credibility of the study's findings.

## 3.9 Method of Data Collection
Data collection was carried out using the self-administered questionnaire method. The researcher distributed the questionnaires to the participants in their homes and requested that they fill it out at a convenient time during the day. The researcher provided a brief explanation of the purpose of the study and the instructions for completing the questionnaire. Data collection lasted for 12 days. A total of 200 copies of the instrument were administered to the respondents. Administered questionnaires were retrieved within a day of administration.

## 3.10 Method of Data Analysis
Data collected was analysed using statistical methods. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the data on the level of awareness of SIDS among the mothers. The data was presented using tables, graphs, and charts.

The instrument for data collection was designed to generate nominal (categorical), ordinal, and interval data. Based upon the fore mentioned, generated nominal and ordinal data was summarised using frequency and percentage. They were further analysed for relationships using Chi square. The generated interval data will be summarised using mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage. It was further analysed for relationships using Chi square. Level of statistical significance will be set at 5%. All data cleaning, coding and analysis will be done with the aid of Statistical Products and Service Solutions (IBM SPSS, Chicago) software version 25.

## 3.11 Ethical Consideration
The topic for the study was approved by the Nursing Department Research Committee in University of Port Harcourt. To gain administrative approval, a letter was sent to the Head of Department. The researcher informed prospective respondents about the study's aim, objectives, advantages, and challenges. All consenting respondents were kept anonymous since no personal identifying details were requested. Strict measures were in place to prevent any form of coercion on the participants, ensuring their involvement was entirely voluntary. Collected data was protected and exclusively used for the approved academic purpose.
