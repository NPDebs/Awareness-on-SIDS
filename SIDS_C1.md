# CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Background to the study
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexpected death of an apparently healthy infant under the age of one year, especially during sleep. The distinguishing factor of this tragic occurrence is that the cause of death remains unexplained after a thorough investigation—clinical history, complete autopsy, and review of the death scene and circumstances (Corwin, 2022). Despite extensive research and prevention efforts, the exact cause of SIDS remains unknown. This means that the family cannot get a medical explanation for why their seemingly healthy infant will never breathe again, leaving them without closure or consolation for such a heartbreaking event.

Globally, SIDS is a major public health concern and is one of the leading causes of death among infants in the first year of life. It is an important cause of infant mortality, as it accounted for ~15,000 infant deaths worldwide in 2013, and an even larger 22,000 deaths in 1990 (Lancet, 2015). The World Health Organisation (WHO) affirms that approximately 2.4 million infants die globally each year, with about 10% of these deaths resulting from SIDS. In 2014, out of the 3,500 Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) deaths reported in the US, ~1,500 (that is, approximately 44% of them) were attributed to SIDS (Tanabe et al., 2018). The significant reduction in SIDS rate between 1990 and 2013 is credited to the discovery of the prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor, which led to the introduction of the “Back to sleep” or “Reduce the risk” campaigns in 1994. These campaigns happened in western countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Sweden (Mitchell et al., 1992). Worthy of note is that these campaigns have saved "3,000 infant lives in New Zealand, 17,000 lives in England and Wales and 40,000 lives in the USA" (Michelle et al., 2012).

In sharp contrast to what is obtainable in high-income countries, very little is known about SIDS in Africa, as there are few studies which have explored the burden of the condition (Ibeziako et al., 2009). These limited studies, however, have revealed that the SIDS rate in Africa is higher than those reported in developed countries (Ikenna et al., 1996). For instance, Osei-Poku et al. stated that “eleven studies reported on the prevalence of SIDS, suggesting high rates of SIDS in Africa”. The prevalence of SIDS ranged from 0.2 per 1000 live births in Zimbabwe, 2.5 per 1000 live births in Niger, and between 3.01 and 3.70 per 1000 live births in South Africa (Osei-Poku et al., 2021). SIDS and other sudden infant deaths accounted for between 2.5 to 21% of infant deaths in South Africa and 11.3% in Zambia. In other countries like Zambia and Nigeria, even less is known about the burden of SIDS. Given the dearth of published studies on SIDS/SUID in Africa, this cause of child mortality has not received adequate attention and has been largely neglected as a priority.

Although SIDS is a significant public health concern in Nigeria, the incidence lacks proper documentation owing to the limited data and under-reporting. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that SIDS is as prevalent in Nigeria as it is in other countries. Some of these articles suggest that the high incidence rate could be due to cultural practices and inadequate knowledge about SIDS (Ibeziako et al., 2009). For instance, Ibeziako et al. reported that bedsharing (another modifiable risk factor for SIDS) is more common in Nigeria than in the US, due to the aforementioned system of belief which promotes rooming-in, and bedding-in. For this reason, this work is both relevant and timely, as it assesses how knowledgeable mothers are about SIDS, specifically in Port Harcourt, where there is limited research on the topic.

Port Harcourt, River State's capital city, is the largest city in the state, with a population of over 1.8 million people.8 Oroworukwo community is one of the densely populated areas in Port Harcourt, and it is home to many young families with infants. With a mix of urban and rural residents, the community encounters countless health challenges, many resulting in high rates of infant mortality and morbidity. Crucial to developing effective intervention to reduce the incidence of SIDS, is an in-depth understanding of the level of awareness of mothers on the subject matter. This is because mothers play a critical role in preventing SIDS, and their knowledge of the condition is essential in drastically reducing its incidence. However, studies have shown that maternal awareness of SIDS is generally low in Nigeria (Ikenna et al., 2019). Thus, it is important to evaluate the level of awareness of mothers on SIDS in Oroworukwo community, Port Harcourt.

Although the exact causes of SIDS are not fully understood, some of the known risk factors include maternal smoking during pregnancy, prone sleeping position, co-sleeping, and overheating. In Nigeria, studies have shown that the incidence of SIDS is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
